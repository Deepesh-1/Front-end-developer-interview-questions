CSS Box Model:

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.
 
p {
margin: 10px;
border: 2px solid black;
padding: 5px;
width: 50px;
height: 10px;
}	 

Total element width = width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border + left margin + right margin

Total element height = height + top padding + bottom padding + top border + bottom border + top margin + bottom margin
